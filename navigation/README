/***************************************************************************
* This implements a basic version of SLAM for SigBOT's Kinect Mapper Project.
* (once its done that is)
*
* Keep the list of sections in development current.  If you are working on a
* section of code please add your name to the developers on it so everyone
* can keep in contact with each other.
*
* The tenative prototypes for each section of the code are completed and 
* should just need the implementation.

To build:

You need to build libfovis first which is located in the odometry folder.  
It is dependant on Openni/freenect and Eigen 3 so you will need to install 
those first then follow the following steps:

cd odometry/libfovis
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig

After installing libfovis you need to change directory back to 
Kinect-Mapper/navigation and then build by:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

Unit tests likely using boost will be added so you should get that soon
as well.

TODO List:

Graph - Need to build a map containing the key features and location of 
each node.

Graph Developers:



Odometry - libfovis can be used to do the odometry.  Just need to interface 
with the library for our purpose.

Odometry Developers:



Utilities - Need to interface with kinect and calculate landmarks pertaining
to current node.

Utilities Developers:



Planning - This can be A* or any other algorithm that can search
through a graph.  This is probably going to be one of the last sections
that need to be completed.
