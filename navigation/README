/***************************************************************************
* This implements a basic version of SLAM for SigBOT's Kinect Mapper Project.
* (once its done that is)
*
* Keep the list of sections in development current.  If you are working on a
* section of code please add your name to the developers on it so everyone
* can keep in contact with each other.
*
* The tenative prototypes for each section of the code are completed and 
* should just need the implementation.

To do:

Graph - Need to build a map containing the key features and location of 
each node.

Graph Developers:



Odometry - libfovis can be used to do the odometry.  Just need to interface

that need to be completed.
